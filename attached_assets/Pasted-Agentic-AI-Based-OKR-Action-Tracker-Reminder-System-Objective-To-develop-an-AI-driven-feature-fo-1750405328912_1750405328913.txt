Agentic AI-Based OKR Action Tracker & Reminder System
Objective
To develop an AI-driven feature for an OKR platform that enhances student engagement by parsing high-level OKRs, generating micro-tasks, sending intelligent reminders, tracking completion status, and updating progress in MongoDB.

Project Scope
Build a full-stack feature integrated into the existing OKR platform.
Implement a multi-agent architecture to handle OKR parsing, task generation, reminders, tracking, and database updates.
Ensure scalability and seamless user experience via dashboard and email notifications.

Agentic AI Workflow - OKR Action Tracker & Reminder System
1. OKR Parser Agent (Uses RAG)
Function:
Reads and interprets high-level OKRs entered by users, extracting key objectives, deliverables, and timelines. Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to leverage past OKR patterns for context.
Input: User-submitted OKR text (e.g., "Publish 3 articles on AI by Q4")
Output: Structured JSON with objectives, deliverables, and deadlines
Acceptance Criteria:
Extracts 90% of relevant fields from OKR text.
Handles ambiguous OKRs using RAG to infer deliverables.
Processes 100 OKRs in under 1 minute.
Supports multiple OKR formats (text, bullet points).
Labels objectives, deliverables, and timelines clearly in JSON output.

2. Micro-Task Generator Agent
Function:
Breaks down OKRs into actionable micro-tasks (daily or weekly) based on the objective and timeline.
Input: Parsed OKR JSON
Output: List of micro-tasks with deadlines and priorities
Acceptance Criteria:
Generates micro-tasks for publishing OKRs (e.g., "Write 500 words for article 1").
Assigns realistic deadlines aligned with OKR timeline.
Prioritizes tasks based on effort.
Handles multiple OKRs in batch.
Outputs structured tasks with description, deadline, and priority.

3. Reminder Agent (Uses RAG)
Function:
Sends intelligent reminders via dashboard or email based on task deadlines and user activity patterns. Uses RAG to personalize reminders with user context.
Input: Micro-task list + user activity data
Output: Scheduled reminders (dashboard notifications or emails)
Acceptance Criteria:
Sends reminders 24 hours before task deadline.
Personalizes reminders using RAG based on user history.
Supports delivery via dashboard and email.
Avoids redundant reminders for the same task.
Tracks and logs successful delivery of reminders.

4. Task Tracker Agent
Function:
Tracks task completion status using user input (e.g., manual confirmation) or external evidence (e.g., GitHub push, LinkedIn post).
Input: Micro-task list + user input/external evidence URLs
Output: Task completion status (completed/pending)
Acceptance Criteria:
Verifies GitHub push aligns with task (e.g., coding problem).
Validates LinkedIn post matches OKR description.
Accepts user input for manual task completion accurately.
Flags broken or irrelevant URLs.
Processes 50 tasks in under 2 minutes.

5. Database Updater Agent
Function:
Auto-updates MongoDB records with task completion status, OKR progress, and reminder logs.
Input: Task completion status + reminder logs
Output: Updated MongoDB records
Acceptance Criteria:
Updates task status in MongoDB (completed/pending).
Logs OKR progress with percentage completion.
Stores reminder logs for audit.
Ensures 99% accuracy in database updates.
Processes updates for 100 tasks in under 1 minute.

Layer Responsibilities
Layer
Responsibility
Frontend
UI for OKR submission, task tracking, and reminder display. Dashboard for progress visualization and manual task confirmation.
Backend
API for OKR parsing, agent triggers, and MongoDB integration. Orchestrates agent communication.
Database
MongoDB to store OKR data, task status, progress, and reminder logs.
AI Integration
Integrates agents using LangChain/Autogen/CrewAI with RAG for context-aware processing.


Testing
Test with sample OKRs (e.g., article publishing, coding challenges).
Validate task generation, reminder delivery, and progress tracking accuracy.
