Design a frontend user interface for a student-facing OKR (Objectives and Key Results) Action Tracker & Reminder System. The interface should support the following end-to-end workflow. This is a single-persona application (student user), and no authentication is required.

UI Requirements:

OKR Submission Page

Input field (multi-line) to enter a high-level OKR (e.g., "Publish 3 articles on AI by Q4").

Submit button to send OKR for processing.

Display of parsed OKR details after submission (Objective, Deliverables, Timeline).

Visual confirmation that OKR was accepted and parsed.

Task Dashboard (Main Page)

Section to display list of micro-tasks (generated from OKR).

Each task should show:

Task description

Deadline

Priority level (Low, Medium, High)

Completion status (checkbox or toggle)

Option to manually mark task as completed.

Real-time progress bar for overall OKR progress.

Reminder Center

Section to view upcoming task deadlines.

Reminder messages (e.g., “Write 500 words for article 1 – due tomorrow”)

Show whether the reminder was delivered via email or dashboard.

Display status (Sent, Viewed, Skipped).

Progress Visualization

Visual tracker (progress bar or pie chart) of overall OKR completion.

Timeline view showing completed vs. pending tasks.

Option to filter by week or objective.

Task Completion Validation Page

Input for user to paste a proof URL (e.g., GitHub link or LinkedIn post).

Manual confirmation option if no link is provided.

Confirmation message upon task verification.

Flow:

User submits a high-level OKR →

Parsed OKR and micro-tasks are displayed →

Tasks appear in dashboard with deadlines and priorities →

Reminders show up on dashboard (and are assumed to be emailed) →

User marks tasks complete manually or with proof →

Progress is reflected in a visual tracker in real-time.

Constraints:

No authentication

Single user persona (student)

No agent logic shown on UI

Focus only on clean, intuitive interaction and visibility into task and OKR progress
